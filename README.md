## An open source distributed social platform

### Main Goals
1. create a fully transparent social platform that is by all means opened and controlled by the public
2. the platform has no centralized computing and storage resources, each app is both the client and part of the distributed server 
3. reach 0 dependancy on 3rd parties in any aspect

### Contributions
I welcome anyone who believes that there is a room for an absolute public social platform, which is completely independent, 
to join me and contribute to this project.
