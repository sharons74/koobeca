# Project Specifications

## CrowdCloud Architecture
All the backend resources should be provided by the public. For example the mobile phones will be used as "Nodes" 
in a distributed network that provides the alternative to classic cloud based services such as storage,database and computing 

[TBD]
  
## Mobile client 
[TBD]

## Authentication
Every node or proxy or client must be authenticated.

TBD

## Communication

Reaching mobile phones through the internet is not trivial.
As of today it usually impossible do directly reach mobile phones without the help of a proxy. 

TBD

## Hardware resources

While the hardware for the nodes is provided by the mobile devices of the public, the hardware of the proxies is not publically available and might cost money.
Two possible ways to tackle this concern are:
1. Use the nodes to create cryptocurrency wich in turn use to buy these resources 
2. Use free tier resources that are provided by commercial vendors.
3. Use public's resources that can function as proxies (like PCs and laptops with public IP)
